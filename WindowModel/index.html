        Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) constitute foundational pillars in computer science and programming. Data structures serve as the architectural framework for organizing and storing data in a computer's memory, determining how information is accessed and manipulated. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. On the other hand, algorithms are step-by-step procedures or instructions designed to solve specific problems or execute particular tasks. They provide a systematic approach to problem-solving and often involve operations such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal. Proficiency in DSA is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code, enabling developers to address complex challenges, optimize performance, and design robust software systems. Moreover, a solid understanding of DSA is often a key component in technical interviews for software development roles.
